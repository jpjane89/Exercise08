SUCCESS is counted sweetest 
By those who ne'er succeed. 
To comprehend a nectar  
Requires sorest need.   
  
Not one of all the purple host          5
Who took the flag to-day    
Can tell the definition,    
So clear, of victory,   
  
As he, defeated, dying, 
On whose forbidden ear          10
The distant strains of triumph  
Break, agonized and clear.

OUR share of night to bear, 
Our share of morning,   
Our blank in bliss to fill, 
Our blank in scorning.  
  
Here a star, and there a star,          5
Some lose their way.    
Here a mist, and there a mist,  
Afterwards--day!

SOUL, wilt thou toss again? 
By just such a hazard   
Hundreds have lost, indeed, 
But tens have won an all.   
  
Angels' breathless ballot           5
Lingers to record thee; 
Imps in eager caucus    
Raffle for my soul.


'T IS so much joy! 'T is so much joy!   
If I should fail, what poverty! 
And yet, as poor as I   
Have ventured all upon a throw; 
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so          5
This side the victory!  
  
Life is but life, and death but death!  
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!  
And if, indeed, I fail, 
At least to know the worst is sweet.            10
Defeat means nothing but defeat,    
No drearier can prevail!    
  
And if I gain,--oh, gun at sea,  
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,  
At first repeat it slow!            15
For heaven is a different thing 
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,   
And might o'erwhelm me so!

GLEE! the great storm is over!  
Four have recovered the land;   
Forty gone down together    
Into the boiling sand.  
  
Ring, for the scant salvation!          5
Toll, for the bonnie souls,--    
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom, 
Spinning upon the shoals!   
  
How they will tell the shipwreck    
When winter shakes the door,            10
Till the children ask, "But the forty?  
Did they come back no more?"    
  
Then a silence suffuses the story,  
And a softness the teller's eye;    
And the children no further question,           15
And only the waves reply.   


IF I can stop one heart from breaking,  
I shall not live in vain;   
If I can ease one life the aching,  
Or cool one pain,   
Or help one fainting robin          5
Unto his nest again,    
I shall not live in vain.

WITHIN my reach!    
I could have touched!   
I might have chanced that way!  
Soft sauntered through the village, 
Sauntered as soft away!         5
So unsuspected violets  
Within the fields lie low,  
Too late for striving fingers   
That passed, an hour ago.

PAIN has an element of blank;   
It cannot recollect 
When it began, or if there were 
A day when it was not.  
  
It has no future but itself,            5
Its infinite realms contain 
Its past, enlightened to perceive   
New periods of pain.    

MINE by the right of the white election!    
Mine by the royal seal! 
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison  
Bars cannot conceal!    
  
Mine, here in vision and in veto!           5
Mine, by the grave's repeal 
Titled, confirmed,--delirious charter!   
Mine, while the ages steal!

YOU left me, sweet, two legacies,--  
A legacy of love    
A Heavenly Father would content,    
Had He the offer of;    
  
You left me boundaries of pain          5
Capacious as the sea,   
Between eternity and time,  
Your consciousness and me.

ALTER? When the hills do.   
Falter? When the sun    
Question if his glory   
Be the perfect one. 
Surfeit? When the daffodil          5
Doth of the dew:    
Even as herself, O friend!  
I will of you!

COME slowly, Eden!  
Lips unused to thee,    
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,  
As the fainting bee,    
  
Reaching late his flower,           5
Round her chamber hums, 
Counts his nectars--enters,  
And is lot in balms!

IF you were coming in the fall, 
I 'd brush the summer by    
With half a smile and half a spurn, 
As housewives do a fly. 
  
If I could see you in a year,           5
I 'd wind the months in balls,  
And put them each in separate drawers,  
Until their time befalls.   
  
If only centuries delayed,  
I 'd count them on my hand,         10
Subtracting till my fingers dropped 
Into Van Diemen's land. 
  
If certain, when this life was out, 
That yours and mine should be,  
I 'd toss it yonder like a rind,            15
And taste eternity. 
  
But now, all ignorant of the length 
Of time's uncertain wing,   
It goads me, like the goblin bee,   
That will not state its sting.

DOUBT me, my dim companion! 
Why, God would be content   
With but a fraction of the love 
Poured thee without a stint.    
The whole of me, forever,           5
What more the woman can,--   
Say quick, that I may dower thee    
With last delight I own!    
  
It cannot be my spirit, 
For that was thine before;          10
I ceded all of dust I knew,--    
What opulence the more  
Had I, a humble maiden, 
Whose farthest of degree    
Was that she might          15
Some distant heaven,    
Dwell timidly with thee!

ELYSIUM is as far as to 
The very nearest room,  
If in that room a friend await  
Felicity or doom.   
  
What fortitude the soul contains,           5
That it can so endure   
The accent of a coming foot,    
The opening of a door!

I GAVE myself to him,   
And took himself for pay.   
The solemn contract of a life   
Was ratified this way.  
  
The wealth might disappoint,            5
Myself a poorer prove   
Than this great purchaser suspect,  
The daily own of Love   
  
Depreciate the vision;  
But, till the merchant buy,         10
Still fable, in the isles of spice, 
The subtle cargoes lie. 
  
At least, 't is mutual risk,--   
Some found it mutual gain;  
Sweet debt of Life,--each night to owe,          15
Insolvent, every noon.

ONE dignity delays for all, 
One mitred afternoon.   
None can avoid this purple, 
None evade this crown.  
  
Coach it insures, and footmen,          5
Chamber and state and throng;   
Bells, also, in the village,    
As we ride grand along. 
  
What dignified attendants,  
What service when we pause!         10
How loyally at parting  
Their hundred hats they raise!  
  
How pomp surpassing ermine, 
When simple you and I   
Present our meek escutcheon,            15
And claim the rank to die!  

DELAYED till she had ceased to know,    
Delayed till in its vest of snow    
  Her loving bosom lay. 
An hour behind the fleeting breath, 
Later by just an hour than death,--          5
  Oh, lagging yesterday!    
  
Could she have guessed that it would be;    
Could but a crier of the glee   
  Have climbed the distant hill;    
Had not the bliss so slow a pace,--          10
Who knows but this surrendered face 
  Were undefeated still?    
  
Oh, if there may departing be   
Any forgot by victory   
  In her imperial round,            15
Show them this meek apparelled thing,   
That could not stop to be a king,   
  Doubtful if it be crowned!

DEPARTED to the judgment,   
A mighty afternoon; 
Great clouds like ushers leaning,   
Creation looking on.    
  
The flesh surrendered, cancelled,           5
The bodiless begun; 
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse    
And leave the soul alone.


SAFE in their alabaster chambers,   
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon, 
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection, 
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone. 
  
Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;          5
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;    
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence,--  
Ah, what sagacity perished here!    
  
Grand go the years in the crescent above them;  
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,            10
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,   
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.

EXULTATION is the going 
Of an inland soul to sea,--  
Past the houses, past the headlands,    
Into deep eternity! 
  
Bred as we, among the mountains,            5
Can the sailor understand   
The divine intoxication 
Of the first league out from land?  

I 'VE seen a dying eye  
Run round and round a room  
In search of something, as it seemed,   
Then cloudier become;   
And then, obscure with fog,         5
And then be soldered down,  
Without disclosing what it be,  
'T were blessed to have seen.

I DIED for beauty, but was scarce   
Adjusted in the tomb,   
When one who died for truth was lain    
In an adjoining room.   
  
He questioned softly why I failed?          5
"For beauty," I replied.    
"And I for truth,--the two are one;  
We brethren are," he said.  
  
And so, as kinsmen met a night, 
We talked between the rooms,            10
Until the moss had reached our lips,    
And covered up our names.

GOING to heaven!    
I don't know when,  
Pray do not ask me how,--    
Indeed, I 'm too astonished 
To think of answering you!          5
Going to heaven!--   
How dim it sounds!  
And yet it will be done 
As sure as flocks go home at night  
Unto the shepherd's arm!            10
  
Perhaps you 're going too!  
Who knows?  
If you should get there first,  
Save just a little place for me 
Close to the two I lost!            15
The smallest "robe" will fit me,    
And just a bit of "crown";  
For you know we do not mind our dress   
When we are going home. 
  
I 'm glad I don't believe it,           20
For it would stop my breath,    
And I 'd like to look a little more 
At such a curious earth!    
I am glad they did believe it   
Whom I have never found         25
Since the mighty autumn afternoon   
I left them in the ground.

AMPLE make this bed.    
Make this bed with awe; 
In it wait till judgment break  
Excellent and fair. 
  
Be its mattress straight,           5
Be its pillow round;    
Let no sunrise' yellow noise    
Interrupt this ground.

IF I should die,    
And you should live,    
And time should gurgle on,  
And morn should beam,   
And noon should burn,           5
As it has usual done;   
If birds should build as early, 
And bees as bustling go,--   
One might depart at option  
From enterprise below!          10
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand  
When we with daisies lie,   
That commerce will continue,    
And trades as briskly fly.  
It makes the parting tranquil           15
And keeps the soul serene,  
That gentlemen so sprightly 
Conduct the pleasing scene!

DEATH is like the insect    
  Menacing the tree,    
Competent to kill it,   
  But decoyed may be.   
  
Bait it with the balsam,            5
  Seek it with the knife,   
Baffle, if it cost you  
  Everything in life.   
  
Then, if it have burrowed   
  Out of reach of skill,            10
Ring the tree and leave it,--    
  'T is the vermin's will.  

HE put the belt around my life,--  
I heard the buckle snap,    
And turned away, imperial,  
My lifetime folding up  
Deliberate, as a duke would do          5
A kingdom's title-deed,--    
Henceforth a dedicated sort,    
A member of the cloud.  
  
Yet not too far to come at call,    
And do the little toils         10
That make the circuit of the rest,  
And deal occasional smiles  
To lives that stoop to notice mine  
And kindly ask it in,--  
Whose invitation, knew you not          15
For whom I must decline?

WHEN roses cease to bloom, dear,    
  And violets are done, 
When bumble-bees in solemn flight   
  Have passed beyond the sun,   
  
The hand that paused to gather          5
  Upon this summer's day    
Will idle lie, in Auburn,--  
  Then take my flower, pray!    

THERE is a word 
Which bears a sword 
  Can pierce an armed man.  
It hurls its barbed syllables,-- 
  At once is mute again.            5
But where it fell   
The saved will tell 
  On patriotic day, 
Some epauletted brother 
  Gave his breath away.         10
  
Wherever runs the breathless sun,   
  Wherever roams the day,   
There is its noiseless onset,   
  There is its victory! 
Behold the keenest marksman!            15
  The most accomplished shot!   
Time's sublimest target 
  Is a soul "forgot"!

POOR little heart!  
      Did they forget thee? 
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!   
  
      Proud little heart!   
      Did they forsake thee?            5
Be debonair! Be debonair!   
  
      Frail little heart!   
      I would not break thee:   
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me? 
  
      Gay little heart!         10
      Like morning glory    
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!

I CANNOT live with you, 
It would be life,   
And life is over there  
Behind the shelf    
  
The sexton keeps the key to,            5
Putting up  
Our life, his porcelain,    
Like a cup  
  
Discarded of the housewife, 
Quaint or broken;           10
A newer Sèvres pleases, 
Old ones crack. 
  
I could not die with you,   
For one must wait   
To shut the other's gaze down,--         15
You could not.  
  
And I, could I stand by 
And see you freeze, 
Without my right of frost,  
Death's privilege?          20
  
Nor could I rise with you,  
Because your face   
Would put out Jesus',   
That new grace  
  
Glow plain and foreign          25
On my homesick eye, 
Except that you, than he    
Shone closer by.    
  
They 'd judge us--how?   
For you served Heaven, you know,            30
Or sought to;   
I could not,    
  
Because you saturated sight,    
And I had no more eyes  
For sordid excellence           35
As Paradise.    
  
And were you lost, I would be,  
Though my name  
Rang loudest    
On the heavenly fame.           40
  
And were you saved, 
And I condemned to be   
Where you were not, 
That self were hell to me.  
  
So we must keep apart,          45
You there, I here,  
With just the door ajar 
That oceans are,    
And prayer, 
And that pale sustenance,           50
Despair!

FATHER, I bring thee not myself,--   
  That were the little load;    
I bring thee the imperial heart 
  I had not strength to hold.   
  
The heart I cherished in my own         5
  Till mine too heavy grew, 
Yet strangest, heavier since it went,   
  Is it too large for you?

A CHARM invests a face  
Imperfectly beheld,--    
The lady dare not lift her veil 
For fear it be dispelled.   
  
But peers beyond her mesh,          5
And wishes, and denies,--    
Lest interview annul a want 
That image satisfies.

I HELD a jewel in my fingers    
And went to sleep.  
The day was warm, and winds were prosy; 
I said: "'T will keep." 
  
I woke and chid my honest fingers,--         5
The gem was gone;   
And now an amethyst remembrance 
Is all I own.

THE NIGHT was wide, and furnished scant 
With but a single star, 
That often as a cloud it met    
Blew out itself for fear.   
  
The wind pursued the little bush,           5
And drove away the leaves   
November left; then clambered up    
And fretted in the eaves.   
  
No squirrel went abroad;    
A dog's belated feet            10
Like intermittent plush were heard  
Adown the empty street. 
  
To feel if blinds be fast,  
And closer to the fire  
Her little rocking-chair to draw,           15
And shiver for the poor,    
  
The housewife's gentle task.    
"How pleasanter," said she  
Unto the sofa opposite, 
"The sleet than May--no thee!"


THAT I did always love, 
I bring thee proof: 
That till I loved   
I did not love enough.  
  
That I shall love alway,            5
I offer thee    
That love is life,  
And life hath immortality.  
  
This, dost thou doubt, sweet?   
Then have I         10
Nothing to show 
But Calvary.

YOUR riches taught me poverty.  
Myself a millionnaire   
In little wealths,--as girls could boast,--   
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,  
  
You drifted your dominions          5
A different Peru;   
And I esteemed all poverty, 
For life's estate with you. 
  
Of mines I little know, myself, 
But just the names of gems,--            10
The colors of the commonest;    
And scarce of diadems   
  
So much that, did I meet the queen, 
Her glory I should know:    
But this must be a different wealth,            15
To miss it beggars so.  
  
I 'm sure 't is India all day   
To those who look on you    
Without a stint, without a blame,--  
Might I but be the Jew!         20
  
I 'm sure it is Golconda,   
Beyond my power to deem,--   
To have a smile for mine each day,  
How better than a gem!  
  
At least, it solaces to know            25
That there exists a gold,   
Although I prove it just in time    
Its distance to behold! 
  
It's far, far treasure to surmise,  
And estimate the pearl          30
That slipped my simple fingers through  
While just a girl at school!    

I HIDE myself within my flower, 
  That wearing on your breast,  
You, unsuspecting, wear me too-- 
And angels know the rest.   
  
I hide myself within my flower,         5
That, fading from your vase,    
You, unsuspecting, feel for me  
Almost a loneliness.

HAVE you got a brook in your little heart,  
Where bashful flowers blow, 
And blushing birds go down to drink,    
And shadows tremble so? 
  
And nobody, knows, so still it flows,           5
That any brook is there;    
And yet your little draught of life 
Is daily drunken there. 
  
Then look out for the little brook in March,    
When the rivers overflow,           10
And the snows come hurrying from the hills, 
And the bridges often go.   
  
And later, in August it may be, 
When the meadows parching lie,  
Beware, lest this little brook of life          15
Some burning noon go dry!

"GOING to him! Happy letter! Tell him--  
Tell him the page I did n't write;  
Tell him I only said the syntax,    
And left the verb and the pronoun out.  
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,          5
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;  
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages, 
So you could see what moved them so.    
  
"Tell him it was n't a practised writer,    
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;          10
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,  
As if it held but the might of a child; 
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.    
Tell him--No, you may quibble there, 
For it would split his heart to know it,            15
And then you and I were silenter.   
  
"Tell him night finished before we finished,    
And the old clock kept neighing ‘day!'  
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended--  
What could it hinder so, to say?            20
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious, 
But if he ask where you are hid 
Until to-morrow,--happy letter!  
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"

WILD nights! Wild nights!   
Were I with thee,   
Wild nights should be   
Our luxury! 
  
Futile the winds            5
To a heart in port,--    
Done with the compass,  
Done with the chart.    
  
Rowing in Eden! 
Ah! the sea!            10
Might I but moor    
To-night in thee!   

HEART, we will forget him!  
  You and I, to-night!  
You may forget the warmth he gave,  
  I will forget the light.  
  
When you have done, pray tell me,           5
  That I my thoughts may dim;   
Haste! lest while you're lagging,   
  I may remember him!   

I LIVE with him, I see his face;  
  I go no more away 
For visitor, or sundown;    
  Death's single privacy,   
  
The only one forestalling mine,         5
  And that by right that he 
Presents a claim invisible, 
  No wedlock granted me.    
  
I live with him, I hear his voice,  
  I stand alive to-day          10
To witness to the certainty 
  Of immortality    
  
Taught me by Time,--the lower way,   
  Conviction every day,--    
That life like this is endless,         15
  Be judgment what it may.

I ENVY seas whereon he rides,   
  I envy spokes of wheels   
Of chariots that him convey,    
  I envy speechless hills   
  
That gaze upon his journey;         5
  How easy all can see  
What is forbidden utterly   
  As heaven, unto me!   
  
I envy nests of sparrows    
  That dot his distant eaves,           10
The wealthy fly upon his pane,  
  The happy, happy leaves   
  
That just abroad his window 
  Have summer's leave to be,    
The earrings of Pizarro         15
  Could not obtain for me.  
  
I envy light that wakes him,    
  And bells that boldly ring    
To tell him it is noon abroad,-- 
  Myself his noon could bring,          20
  
Yet interdict my blossom    
  And abrogate my bee,  
Lest noon in everlasting night  
  Drop Gabriel and me.

A SOLEMN thing it was, I said,  
  A woman white to be,  
And wear, if God should count me fit,   
  Her hallowed mystery. 
  
A timid thing to drop a life            5
  Into the purple well, 
Too plummetless that it come back   
  Eternity until.

'T WAS a long parting, but the time 
For interview had come; 
Before the judgment-seat of God,    
The last and second time    
  
These fleshless lovers met,         5
A heaven in a gaze, 
A heaven of heavens, the privilege  
Of one another's eyes.  
  
No lifetime set on them,    
Apparelled as the new           10
Unborn, except they had beheld, 
Born everlasting now.   
  
Was bridal e'er like this?  
A paradise, the host,   
And cherubim and seraphim           15
The most familiar guest.

DID the harebell loose her girdle   
To the lover bee,   
Would the bee the harebell hallow   
Much as formerly?   
  
Did the paradise, persuaded,            5
Yield her moat of pearl,    
Would the Eden be an Eden,  
Or the earl an earl?

PROUD of my broken heart since thou didst break it, 
  Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,   
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,  
  Not to partake thy passion, my humility.

TO lose thee, sweeter than to gain  
  All other hearts I knew.  
'T is true the drought is destitute,    
  But then I had the dew!   
  
The Caspian has its realms of sand,         5
  Its other realm of sea;   
Without the sterile perquisite  
  No Caspian could be.

ADVENTURE most unto itself  
The Soul condemned to be;   
Attended by a Single Hound-- 
Its own Identity.

MY Wheel is in the dark,--   
I cannot see a spoke,   
Yet know its dripping feet  
Go round and round. 
  
My foot is on the tide--         5
An unfrequented road,   
Yet have all roads  
A "clearing" at the end.    
  
Some have resigned the Loom,    
Some in the busy tomb           10
Find quaint employ, 
Some with new, stately feet 
Pass royal through the gate,    
Flinging the problem back at you and I.

SO gay a flower bereaved the mind   
As if it were a woe,    
Is Beauty an affliction, then?  
Tradition ought to know.

GLOWING is her Bonnet,  
Glowing is her Cheek,   
Glowing is her Kirtle,  
Yet she cannot speak!   
  
Better, as the Daisy            5
From the Summer hill,   
Vanish unrecorded   
Save by tearful Rill,   
  
Save by loving Sunrise  
Looking for her face,           10
Save by feet unnumbered 
Pausing at the place!   


I WATCHED her face to see which way 
She took the awful news,    
Whether she died before she heard--  
Or in protracted bruise 
Remained a few short years with us,         5
Each heavier than the last-- 
A further afternoon to fail,    
As Flower at fall of Frost.


THE LOOK of Thee, what is it like?  
Hast thou a hand or foot,   
Or mansion of Identity, 
And what is thy Pursuit?    
  
Thy fellows,--are they Realms or Themes?         5
Hast thou Delight or Fear   
Or Longing,--and is that for us  
Or values more severe?  
  
Let change transfuse all other traits,  
Enact all other blame,          10
But deign this least certificate--   
That thou shalt be the same.


THE FACE we choose to miss, 
Be it but for a day--    
As absent as a hundred years    
When it has rode away.


I DID not reach thee,   
But my feet slip nearer every day;  
Three Rivers and a Hill to cross,   
One Desert and a Sea--   
I shall not count the journey one           5
When I am telling thee. 
  
Two deserts--but the year is cold    
So that will help the sand-- 
One desert crossed, the second one  
Will feel as cool as land.          10
Sahara is too little price  
To pay for thy Right hand!  
  
The sea comes last. Step merry, feet!   
So short have we to go  
To play together we are prone,          15
But we must labor now,  
The last shall be the lightest load 
That we have had to draw.   
  
The Sun goes crooked--that is night-- 
Before he makes the bend            20
We must have passed the middle sea, 
Almost we wish the end  
Were further off--too great it seems 
So near the Whole to stand. 
  
We step like plush, we stand like snow--         25
The waters murmur now,  
Three rivers and the hill are passed,   
Two deserts and the sea!    
Now Death usurps my premium 
And gets the look at Thee.

THAT she forgot me was the least,   
I felt it second pain,  
That I was worthy to forget 
What most I thought upon.   
  
Faithful, was all that I could boast,           5
But Constancy became,   
To her, by her innominate,  
A something like a shame.

TO tell the beauty would decrease,  
To state the Spell demean,  
There is a syllableless sea 
Of which it is the sign.    
  
My will endeavours for its word         5
And fails, but entertains   
A rapture as of legacies--   
Of introspective mines.

JUST so, Jesus raps--He does not weary--  
Last at the knocker and first at the bell,  
Then on divinest tiptoe standing    
Might He out-spy the lady's soul.   
When He retires, chilled and weary--         5
It will be ample time for me;   
Patient, upon the steps, until then--    
Heart, I am knocking low at Thee!

HOW destitute is he 
Whose Gold is firm, 
Who finds it every time,    
The small stale sum--    
When Love, with but a pence         5
Will so display,    
As is a disrespect to India!    

THE STARS are old, that stood for me--   
The West a little worn, 
Yet newer glows the only Gold   
I ever cared to earn--   
Presuming on that lone result           5
Her infinite disdain,   
But vanquished her with my defeat,  
'T was Victory was slain.


I SHOWED her heights she never saw-- 
"Wouldst climb?" I said,    
She said "Not so"--  
"With me?" I said, "With me?"   
I showed her secrets            5
Morning's nest, 
The rope that Nights were put across--   
And now, "Wouldst have me for a Guest?" 
She could not find her yes-- 
And then, I brake my life, and Lo!          10
A light for her, did solemn glow,   
The larger, as her face withdrew--   
And could she, further, "No?"

TO see her is a picture,    
To hear her is a tune,  
To know her an intemperance 
As innocent as June;    
By which to be undone           5
Is dearer than Redemption--  
Which never to receive, 
Makes mockery of melody 
It might have been to live.

LOVE reckons by itself alone,   
"As large as I" relate the Sun  
To one who never felt it blaze, 
Itself is all the like it has.

THAT Love is all there is,  
Is all we know of Love; 
It is enough, the freight should be 
Proportioned to the groove.

HER Grace is all she has,   
And that, so vast displays, 
One Art, to recognize, must be, 
Another Art to praise.


IF pain for peace prepares, 
Lo the "Augustan" years 
Our feet await! 
  
If Springs from Winter rise,    
Can the Anemone's           5
Be reckoned up? 
  
If night stands first, then noon,   
To gird us for the sun, 
What gaze--  
  
When, from a thousand skies,            10
On our developed eyes   
Noons blaze!

OF Death the sharpest function, 
That, just as we discern,   
The Excellence defies us;   
Securest gathered then  
The fruit perverse to plucking,         5
But leaning to the sight    
With the ecstatic limit 
Of unobtained Delight.

THE LARGEST fire ever known 
Occurs each afternoon,  
Discovered is without surprise, 
Proceeds without concern:   
Consumes, and no report to men,         5
An Occidental town, 
Rebuilt another morning 
To be again burned down.

NATURE is what we see,  
  The Hill, the Afternoon--  
Squirrel, Eclipse, the Bumble-bee,  
Nay--Nature is Heaven.   
  
Nature is what we hear,         5
The Bobolink, the Sea--  
Thunder, the Cricket--   
Nay,--Nature is Harmony. 
  
Nature is what we know  
But have no art to say,         10
So impotent our wisdom is   
To Her simplicity.

TO be alive is power,   
Existence in itself,    
Without a further function, 
Omnipotence enough. 
  
To be alive and Will--           5
'T is able as a God!    
The Further of ourselves be what--   
Such being Finitude?
