Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service, in the club, you see, you see
Wha-Wha-What did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy

Just a second, its my favorite song they gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don' wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
(I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)

Call all you want, but theres no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want, but theres no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster

I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'

'Cause I'll be dancin'
'Cause I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'

Stop callin', stop callin', I don' wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop callin', stop callin', I don' wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me

And you're not gonna reach my telephone

We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It so magical, we'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing light
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa, paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price, loving you is cherry pie
Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be

The way she moves, the way she walks
I touch myself, can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright

Just give in, don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
Eh-eh, eh-eh, so happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever

I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair, I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place
I take my time, I put it back
I touch myself till I'm on track

Just give in, don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time

RedOne, Konvict

All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
How does he twist the dance? Can't find a drink, oh man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone

Shawty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me

I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up, you gave up

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again, oh boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again, oh boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart, seams
On my bubble dreams, bubble dreams

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again, oh boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
And I'll never love again, oh friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

How? How? How?
How? How? How?

And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up? Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up? Could you give it all up if I promise boy to you?

That I'll never talk again and I'll never love again
I'll never write a song, won't even sing along
I'll never love again, so speechless
You left me speechless, so speechless

Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless, so speechless
Some men may follow me
But you choose any girl but me
Why you so speechless? Oh, oh

Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah

I wanna hold em like they do in Texas Plays
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me, I love it
Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand cause I'm marvelous

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my

But I just can't be with you

At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro

But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes

In your brown eyes I walked away
In your brown eyes I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong

If everything was everything but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

In your brown eyes I was feeling low
'Cause they're brown eyes and you never know
Got some brown eyes but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong
So baby, turn the record on, play that song

Where everything was everything but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes, brown eyes

Everything was everything but baby, it's the last show
Everything could be everything but it's time to say goodbye, so
Get your last fix and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes

In your brown eyes, brown, brown eyes

Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga
Judas Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga

When he comes to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked way
I've learned love is like a brick you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

In the most biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense I just speak in future tense
Judas kiss me if offense, don't wear your condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to

Just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga

Oh oh, oh oh. Oh!*

Black lights and designer blues
With my tattoos of I-love-yous.
I just put on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you.

I’m livin’ it up,
Secretly he notices I’m playin’ it up

Dancin’ on the tables as the DJ’s
Spinnin’ it up

Spinnin’ it up

When the sun goes down
And the care ends up
It’s time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playin’ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.

Stare in my direction.
I’m craving your attention

Too hot for the masses,
She’s on fire.
Think I’m gonna let her burn.
Champagne in the glasses,
Flip the bottle, baby.
Come ‘n’ take your turn.
She’s on my radar.
Catch ya later
Cuz she knows
When I push the fader
She ain’t leaving me alone.

What if I were to leave you?*
But then, you fell back in love with me

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar
I just can't seem to forget you!
Not ever since as long as I left you!
Your my baby, you
Never made it through to you

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar
I just can't seem to forget you!
Not ever since as long as I left you!
Your my baby, you
Never made it through to you

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

[Instrumental]

If I was the last girl, and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl and you were the last boy
Left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love
Baby, then you'd love me.

I'm gonna marry the night
I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight

I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to this dark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I'm a winner

I'm gonna marry the night
Gonna marry the night
Gonna bury the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on this street to explore

M-m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night
Oh, m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night

I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the street that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner

Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on this street to explore

M-m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night
Oh, m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night

Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is love, just a tan that you'll never lose.
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic

Get ginger ready, climb in Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love

Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explode

M-m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night
Oh, m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night

Oh, m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the night

I'm gonna marry, marry
I'm gonna marry, marry
Come on, come on

The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night, the night
